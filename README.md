# EchoTrail

EchoTrail is a lightweight, component-agnostic structured logging library for Android. It helps developers trace the execution of business logic across layers like use cases, repositories, ViewModels, mappers, and utility functions ‚Äî without polluting the codebase with ad-hoc `Log.d()` or print statements.

## ‚ú® Why EchoTrail?

Debugging complex flows in a modular codebase can be time-consuming. EchoTrail gives you a consistent, readable, and structured way to track what's happening inside your logic ‚Äî so you can catch issues faster, understand behaviors clearly, and stay in flow.

## üöÄ Features

* `logExecution(tag, input) { ... }` inline wrapper for synchronous code
* `logExecutionSuspend(tag, input) { ... }` suspend-friendly variant for coroutine use
* Logs:

  * Start event with inputs
  * Success with result and execution time
  * Failure with error message and duration
* Output to Logcat in structured format
* Enabled in debug builds only by default
* Minimal setup, works across all layers of your app

## üß± Log Format

```
[2025-06-01 14:05:33] [INFO] [LoginUseCase] Started with input: email=abc@example.com
[2025-06-01 14:05:33] [INFO] [LoginUseCase] Success with result: AuthToken(token=xyz) in 120ms
[2025-06-01 14:05:33] [ERROR] [LoginUseCase] Failed with error: NullPointerException - user is null in 25ms
```

## üõ† How to Use

### 1. Add JitPack Repository

```kotlin
repositories {
  maven("https://jitpack.io")
}
```

### 2. Add Dependency

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("com.github.NovaNestApps:EchoTrail:1.0.0")
}
```

### 3. Wrap Any Logic

```kotlin
val result = logExecution("MyUseCase", input = "userId=2") {
  repository.fetchUser("2")
}
```

### 4. Wrap Suspend Calls

```kotlin
val response = logExecutionSuspend("ApiCall", input = "email=test@mail.com") {
  api.login("test@mail.com", "password")
}
```

### 5. Customize Logger (optional)

```kotlin
EchoTrailConfig.logger = MyCustomLogger()
EchoTrailConfig.isLoggingEnabled = BuildConfig.DEBUG
```

## üß™ Sample App Included

The demo app shows how to:

* Use EchoTrail to wrap a Retrofit API call
* View the log trace for start, success, and failure
* Output response and error clearly in Logcat
